**1. Please, explain in your own words what this fragment of code does. It is ok to describe the functionality in broad terms.**

> Setting up a connection to a MySQL database and Amazon SNS. Fetching up the user profile info from the user table on the database and sending a notification to the user through the SNS service.

**2. What information do you think is missing to understand the purpose of this code fully.**

> We need more info about the database's tables and how they are related. For example, isn't clear if the column service_link belongs to a different table o why there is a table called phone_number, it seems is a column, not a table. The phone_numbers column is confusing too. Why search phone numbers by phone_id?

**3. Now, take the time to reread the code, and please suggest all the refactoring you consider necessary. You can aim to improve the code in several ways. For example, is there a way to make this code more readable or improve performance or security?**

> [See src/after.py file](src/after.py)

**4. As you may suspect by now, this code is part of a more extensive system. With the information that you have, can you explain how the architecture of this system is? You can be as detailed as you want. You can use draws or diagrams if you find it necessary.**

> I do think that this code belongs to a microservice running in a different process, like an autonomous service.
I can imagine that this system has many different microservices that perform specific tasks like processing payments, sending emails and notifications to users, creating bills, generating reports, and so on.
